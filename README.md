## 💬 ABOUT ME

PHP Developer with over 6 years of commercial experience in eCommerce, eMarketing, and iGaming. I have worked in teams from 2 to 30 members, remotely, onsite, and hybrid, with nearly 2 years of team-leading experience. I have built web applications from scratch, from product concepts to automated releases, with high unit test coverage, integrated analytics, and CI/CD. I have successfully renewed legacy projects, providing technical leadership. Over the last 5 years, I have worked on high-load systems developed by my teams. Recent experience includes query optimization, sharding, load balancing, creating microservices, and maintaining large applications on both backend and frontend as a tech lead developer.
